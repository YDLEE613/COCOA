Problem:
----------
An integer N can be represented by the sum of squared numbers (where numbers <= N). 

For example, 11 = 3^2 + 1^2 + 1^2.
11 can be also represented by 2^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2. 

If an integer N is given, calculate the smallest number of 'squared numbers' to represent the integer N.

Input:
-------
First line: N (<= N <= 100,000)

Output:
-------
First line: number of 'squared numbers'

Example:
-------
Input | Output
------|-------
7 | 4
